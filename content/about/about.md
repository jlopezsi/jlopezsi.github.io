Hi, I'm jordi! I'm a software engineer living and working in London.

I work mostly in <a href="http://elixir-lang.org/">Elixir</a> and Java.

My main interest is in server-side technology and massive scalability, but I've been known to dabble in native mobile development, user facing web applications and various other projects.

Check out my [GitHub page](https://github.com/zyro) to see what I've been up to recently!
